# Epidemic-Genius
A program that will evaluate the potential risks of spread of an epidemic based on the Input go the viruses given

## Description
This project is a Tkinter-based application for simulating the spread of a disease in a specific country. It uses user-provided parameters like the country name, initial infected population, spread rate, recovery rate, and simulation duration to model the infection progression over time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: tkinter, matplotlib, pandas, PIL

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3.x and the required libraries installed.
3. Run the application using the command: `python main.py`.
4. The GUI window will open, prompting you to input the necessary parameters for the simulation.
5. Click the "Calculate" button to initiate the simulation.
6. A new window will display the graph showing the number of infected individuals over time and a description of the simulation results.



## Files and Directory Structure
- `main.py`: The main Python script containing the Tkinter application code.
- `worldpopulation.csv`: CSV file containing population data for different countries.
- `screenshots/`: Directory containing screenshots used in the README.

## Data Source
The population data used in this simulation is obtained from the 'worldpopulation.csv' file, which is included in the project.
